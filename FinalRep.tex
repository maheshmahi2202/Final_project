\maketitle
\end{center}
In order to ensure the safe supply of the drinking water, its quality need to be monitored in real time. The design and development of a low cost system for a real time monitoring of the water quality through IoT (Internet of Things) is presented in this project. This system consists of several sensors like temperature, pH, turbidity, and conductivity which are used in measuring physical and chemical parameters of the water. The measured values from the sensors can be processed by the core controller. The Arduino and Wi-Fi module can be used as a core controller. Finally, the sensor data can be viewed on internet.

\section{HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION}
\end{center}
This chapter divulges about the hardware and software requirements that mainly elucidates hardware specifications and features, and software platforms used to develop the code (programming) to achieve the purpose of the project as desired. 
\subsubsection{ARDUINO UNO}
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Uno differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega8U2 programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.

Starting clockwise from the top center: 
\begin{itemize}


\item Analog Reference pin (orange) 
\item Digital Ground (light green) 

\item Digital Pins 2-13 (green) 

\item Digital Pins 0-1/Serial In/Out - TX/RX (dark green) 

\item Reset Button - S1 (dark blue) 

\item In-circuit Serial Programmer (blue-green)

\item External Power Supply In (9-12VDC) - X1 (pink) 
\item USB (used for uploading sketches to the board and for serial communication between the board and the computer; can be used to power the board) (yellow)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Digital pins}
\paragraph{•}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ Serial: ] 0(RX) and 1(TX). Used to receive(RX)and transmit(TX) TTL serial data. On the Arduino Diecimila, these pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the FTDI USB-to-TTL Serial chip. On the Arduino BT, they are connected to the corresponding pins of the WT11 Bluetooth module. On the Arduino Mini and LilyPad Arduino, they are intended for use with an external TTL serial module (e.g. the Mini-USB Adapter). 
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ External Interrupts :] 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value.  
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ PWM: ] 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. On boards with an ATmega8, PWM output is available only on pins 9, 10, and 11.  
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ BT Reset: ] 7. (Arduino BT-only) Connected to the reset line of the bluetooth module.   
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ SPI: ] 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication, which, although provided by the underlying hardware, is not currently included in the Arduino language. 
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ LED:] 13. On the Diecimila and LilyPad, there is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Analog pins}
\paragraph{•}
In addition to the specific functions listed below, the analog input pins support 10-bit analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) using the analogRead() function. Most of the analog inputs can also be used as digital pins: analog input 0 as digital pin 14 through analog input 5 as digital pin 19. Analog inputs 6 and 7 (present on the Mini and BT) cannot be used as digital pins. 
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ I2C:] 13. On the Diecimila and LilyPad, there is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off. 
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Power pins}
\paragraph{•}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ VIN:] The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin. Note that different boards accept different input voltages ranges, please see the documentation for your board. Also note that the LilyPad has no VIN pin and accepts only a regulated input. 
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ 5V:] The regulated power supply used to power the microcontroller and other components on the board. This can come either from VIN via an on-board regulator, or be supplied by USB or another regulated 5V supply.  
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ 3.3V] A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board FTDI chip. GND. Ground pins. 
\end{description}
\subsection{ESP8266-12E WiFi MODULE}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{wifi.png}
\end{center}
\paragraph{•}ESP-12E WiFi module is developed by Ai-thinker Team. core processor ESP8266 in smaller sizes of the module encapsulates Tensilica L106 integrates industry-leading ultra-low power 32-bit MCU micro, with the 16-bit short mode, Clock speed support 80 MHz, 160 MHz, supports the RTOS, integrated Wi-Fi MAC/BB/RF/PA/LNA, on-board antenna. The module supports standard IEEE802.11 b/g/n agreement, complete TCP/IP protocol stack. Users can use the add modules to an existing device networking, or building a separate network controller. ESP8266 is high integration wireless SOCs, designed for space and power constrained mobile platform designers. It provides unsurpassed ability to embed Wi-Fi capabilities within other systems, or to function as a standalone application, with the lowest cost, and minimal space requirement.
\paragraph{•}
ESP8266EX offers a complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking solution; it can be used to host the application or to offload Wi-Fi networking functions from another application processor. When ESP8266EX hosts the application, it boots up directly from an external flash. Alternately, serving as a Wi-Fi adapter, wireless internet access can be added to any micro controller based design with simple connectivity (SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interface).

\subsection{TEMPERATURE SENSOR LM35}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{temp.png}
\end{center}
\paragraph{As a temperature sensor, the circuit will read the temperature of the surrounding environment and relay this temperature to us back in degrees Celsius. The IC we used to measure the temperature is the LM35 IC integrated with the Arduino UNO to measure the temperature of the system. The Arduino UNO will then read this measured value from the LM35 (a low voltage IC, with 3 pins, uses approx. +5VDC) and translate into degrees Fahrenheit/Celsius, which we will be able to read from the computer from the Arduino serial monitor. 
}
\paragraph{The output pin provides an analog voltage output that is linearly proportional to the Celsius (Centigrade) temperature. Pin 2 gives an output of 1 millivolt per 0.1°C (10mV per degree). So to get the degree value in Celsius, all that must be done is to take the voltage output and divide it by 10- this give out the value degrees in Celsius. So, for example, if the output pin, pin 2, gives out a value of 315mV (0.315V), this is equivalent to a temperature of 31.5°C.
